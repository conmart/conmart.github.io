        I joined NexHealth as a T3 support engineer acting as a buffer between 
        the support and engineering orgs. I had the opportunity to wear many 
        hats including sales engineering, solution engineering for API partners 
        and running technical trainings for the support org, but most of my time 
        was spent cutting tickets for engineering and deploying hotfixes.

        I then transitioned to engineering full time specializing in supporting 
        our non-cloud software integrations. This included adding new 
        functionality, bolstering tests, and refactoring our read cycles to make 
        our integrations far more efficient.

        Fresh out of General Assembly's web developer bootcamp my first role in 
        working directly with software came as a support engineer for Rooster 
        Grin - a small web shop specializing in building and maintaining 
        websites for orthodontists.

        After a year of web development I joined Rooster Grin's full stack team 
        working on integrating with 3rd party practice management systems to 
        provide appointment scheduling and reminders for patients. Eventually I 
        became the most senior engineer on the team and co-lead our pod of three 
        engineers.

        As one of the founding members of NerdWallet's Sales and Partnerships 
        team I worked with banks and credit unions across the country to improve 
        their financial literacy content and boost their online presence. 
        I was also selected to lead initial outreach efforts for a new B2B 
        spinoff product aimed at improving employees' understanding of their 
        health benefits dubbed "NerdWallet Health".

        During this chapter of my life I was introduced to how exciting and 
        volatile startup life can be, learned a lot about personal finance, and 
        even started training to be a Salesforce DBA as a way to transition from 
        sales into something more technical.

      <div>Proud UC Berkeley Alumnus, I was captivated by Psychology and loved 
        gaining a deeper understanding of human behaviors and motivations. It 
        wasn't until late in my third year that I took an introductory computer 
        science course and was first exposed to another passion that would 
        eventually become my career.
