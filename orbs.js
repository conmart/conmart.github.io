        As one of the founding members of NerdWallet's Sales and Partnerships 
        team I worked with banks and credit unions across the country to improve 
        their financial literacy content and boost their online presence. 
        I was also selected to lead initial outreach efforts for a new B2B 
        spinoff product aimed at improving employees' understanding of their 
        health benefits dubbed "NerdWallet Health".

        During this chapter of my life I was introduced to how exciting and 
        volatile startup life can be, learned a lot about personal finance, and 
        even started training to be a Salesforce DBA as a way to transition from 
        sales into something more technical.

      <div>Proud UC Berkeley Alumnus, I was captivated by Psychology and loved 
        gaining a deeper understanding of human behaviors and motivations. It 
        wasn't until late in my third year that I took an introductory computer 
        science course and was first exposed to another passion that would 
        eventually become my career.
